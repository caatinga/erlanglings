# Erlanglings

Greetings and welcome to Erlanglings.
This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Erlang code.
This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!

It is recommended to do the Erlanglings exercises in parallel to reading [the official Erlang documentation](https://www.erlang.org/docs), the most comprehensive resource for learning ErlangüìöÔ∏è

## Getting Started

### Installing Erlang

Before starting Erlanglings, you need to have the **latest version of Erlang** installed.
Visit [Erlang Official page](https://www.erlang.org/downloads) for further instructions on installing Erlang.
This will also install _RBar3_, Erlang package/project manager.

## Working environment

### Editor

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pgourlain.erlang
Our general recommendation is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [erlang plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pgourlain.erlang) or [erlang-ls plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=erlang-ls.erlang-ls).
But any editor that supports [erlang-ls](https://erlang-ls.github.io/) should be enough for working on the exercises.

### Terminal

While working with Erlanglings, please use a modern terminal for the best user experience.
The default terminal on Linux and Mac should be sufficient.
On Windows, we recommend the [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal).

## Doing exercises

The exercises are sorted by topic and can be found in the subdirectory `exercises/<topic>`.
For every topic, there is an additional `README.md` file with some resources to get you started on the topic.
We highly recommend that you have a look at them before you start üìöÔ∏è

Most exercises contain an error that keeps them from compiling, and it's up to you to fix it!
Some exercises contain tests that need to pass for the exercise to be done ‚úÖ

Search for `TODO` or `undefined.` to find out what you need to change.
