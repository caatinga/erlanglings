# Pattern Matching

In this exercise, you will practice pattern matching with tuples, lists, and maps.

## Instructions

1. Open the file `pattern_matching.erl`.
2. Implement the functions:

- `match_tuple/1`: Return the sum of the two elements in the tuple.
- `match_list/1`: Return the head of the list.
- `match_map/1`: Return the value associated with the key `key`.

3. Run the tests to check your solution.

## How to Run Tests

In the terminal, run:

```sh
make test
```
